## Deploy with Docker-Compose üê¨

While in the root directory, create a .env file

```ruby
# FRONTEND
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4000/api"

# BACKEND
FRONTEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5173"
S3_BUCKET_NAME=""
AWS_REGION=""
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
MONGO_URL="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"
JWT_TOKEN=""

# DATABASE
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME="enter your username"
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="enter your password"

# APP VARS
APP_NAME="tripvibe"
```

Then run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Deploy with Terraform üê¢

You must have exported your AWS credentials

```sh
export AWS_REGION=(your aws region)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

### Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. We have made every effort to ensure all the resources qualify for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), but we are not responsible for any charges you may incur.*

### Required varibles

```python
grafana
domain name
grafana_account_id
external_id
aws_acm_certificate
```

Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm run build` to generate a build folder, which terraform will upload its contents to your s3 bucket

Navigate to the `terraform/env/dev` directory then run 

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Once you have confirmed that you're good with the proposed changes, run

```sh
terraform apply
```
